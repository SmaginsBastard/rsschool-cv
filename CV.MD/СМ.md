## Briefly About Myself:
While studying at the 3rd year of the University of Economics in St. Petersburg, I realized that I want to connect my life with IT, my friend at that time was already a middle in the team gave a couple of tips on where to start

 So I got acquainted with HTML and CSS further more I found a wonderful course from RS SCHOOLS and now I am going through its first stage

 I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
